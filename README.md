## Inspiration

The TypeScript Playground V2 comes packed with lots of new features, including the ability to create plugins. Per the TypeScript docs:

> The new TypeScript Playground allows people to hook into the Playground and extend it in ways in which the TypeScript team don't expect.
>
> The sidebar of the Playground uses the same plugin infrastructure as external plugins, so you have the same level of access as the playground to build interesting projects.
>
> Playground plugins have no fancy frameworks, you're free to inject them at runtime and use them if you need to - but the current plugins are built with the DOM APIs and TypeScript.

Since Svelte can be compiled down to dependency-free JavaScript classes, it offers a great, declarative alternative to writing imperative markup with the DOM APIs. This library allows you to use Svelte as a replacement or addition to the DOM APIs to create a rich, interactive UI for your plugin.

## How To Use This Starter

#### Step 1. Clone this repo and navigate to the directory

```sh
git clone git@github.com:gojutin/typescript-playground-plugin-svelte.git
```

```sh
cd typescript-playground-plugin-svelte
```

#### Step 2. Download dependencies

```sh
npm install
```

#### Step 3. Start the development server

```sh
npm start
```

This will start a development server with live reloading of your plugin. As you edit any files in the `src` directory, the app will recompile and update `dist/index.js`, which is the file that is served to the TypeScript Playground.

> _Note: This does not reload the browser when your files change. In order to see your changes, the browser will need to be manually reloaded each time you make changes to the plugin._

#### Step 4. Configure and use your plugin

You can further customize your plugin by modifying the `customPlugin` object in `src/index.ts`. For instance, you can change the `displayName` property to change the label of the tab for your plugin. See the `PlaygroundPlugin` interface in `vendor/playground.d.ts` for all of the available options.

Visit [https://www.typescriptlang.org/v2/en/play](https://www.typescriptlang.org/v2/en/play).

Select the **Options** tab and tick the box for **Connect to localhost:5000/index.js**.

Now, **refresh the browser**. When the playground reeoads, a new tab with your plugin should appear! ðŸŽ‰

## Props

The TypeScript Playground Plugin API provides lifecycle methods that are used to interact with the playground. This library uses [writable store objects](https://svelte.dev/tutorial/writable-stores) to provide the values provided by these lifecycle methods to the Svelte app via props. The following props are provided to your Svelte app and are named based on the lifecycle method that they are generated from:

- `didMount`
- `modelChanged`
- `modelChangedDebounce`
- `willUnmount`
- `didUnmount`

You can access them in `App.svelte` like so:

```html
<script>
  export let didMount;
  export let modelChanged;
  export let modelChangedDebounce;
  export let willUnmount;
  export let didUnmount;

  // auto-subscribe
  const { sandbox } = $modelChanged;
</script>
```

#### `didMount`, `willUnmount`, and `didUnmount`

Runs once. Returns `{container, sandbox}`

- `container`

  This is the root container element that your Svelte app is mounted to.

- `sandbox`

  This object provides several properties and methods to interact with the playground. See all of the available types in `src/vendor/sandbox.d.ts`.

#### `modelChanged`

Runs on model change. Returns `{sandbox, model}`

#### `modelChangedDebounce`

Runs with delay on model change. Returns `{sandbox, model}`

The `modelChanged` and `modelChangedDebounce` methods provide the current state of the editor as the code changes. The return values of both methods are passed into the Svelte app as props via a writable store instance. You can easily auto-subscribe to these values to be notified when any changes occur.

App.svelte

```html
<script>
  export let modelChanged;
  export let modelChangedDebounce;

  // Auto-subscribe to any changes
  $: {
    const { sandbox, model } = $modelChanged;
    console.log(sandbox.getText(), model);
  }

  $: {
    const { sandbox, model } = $modelChangedDebounce;
    console.log(sandbox.getText(), model);
  }
</script>
```

## Styling your plugin

Style you Svelte components as normal. All styles defined in your Svelte components are automatically injected into the page at render time. You can read more about styling Svelte components at [https://svelte.dev/docs#style](https://svelte.dev/docs#style).

The `didMount` prop also provides the container element, which you can apply styles to. Be cautious as this will affect all tabs in the sidebar.

## More about TypeScript Playground Plugins

The `src/vendor` directory contains all of the TypeScript type definitions for the TypeScript Playground Plugin API. This is the best place to find the various config options, properties, and methods that are available.

This repo also contains the `CONTRIBUTING.md` guide provided by the TypeScript team. It includes more information about how to work with plugins.
